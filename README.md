# Music Store SQL Analysis

This project showcases my ability to explore and analyze relational data using SQL.  
I worked with a sample **Music Store** database containing tables for customers, invoices, tracks, artists, albums, and genres.

## Objective
Answer business-style questions such as:
- List email, first name, and last name of all Rock music listeners
- Find the top 10 rock artists by total track count
- Identify tracks longer than the average song length
- Analyze sales and customer purchase patterns

## Skills & Concepts Used
- PostgreSQL (queries are also compatible with MySQL)
- INNER JOIN across multiple tables
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
- GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
- Subqueries for filtering and calculations

## Files in This Repo
- **queries.sql** â€“ All SQL queries I wrote, with short comments explaining each question.

## How to Reproduce
1. Import the sample Music Store database into PostgreSQL or MySQL.
2. Open `queries.sql` in your SQL client (e.g., pgAdmin).
3. Run individual queries to reproduce the analysis.

## Key Takeaways
- Demonstrated ability to translate business questions into SQL queries.
- Practiced data cleaning, joins, and aggregations on a multi-table dataset.
